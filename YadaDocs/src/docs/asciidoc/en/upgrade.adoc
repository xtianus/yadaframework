:docinfo: shared

Sometimes you have to forget the past

==  Latest Stable Version

The current stable version of the Yada Framework is https://github.com/xtianus/yadaframework/tree/0.7.6[0.7.6^]

Version https://github.com/xtianus/yadaframework/tree/0.7.7[0.7.7^] has more features but it
changes very frequently and the new API may not be stable. This documentation, though,
is for this version.

Both use JDK17, Spring 6, Hibernate 6, Bootstrap 3 to 5, Tomcat 10
