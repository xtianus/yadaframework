The current stable version of the Yada Framework is https://github.com/xtianus/yadaframework/tree/0.7.8[0.7.8^]

Version https://github.com/xtianus/yadaframework/tree/0.7.8.1[0.7.8.1^] has more features but it
changes frequently and the new API may not be stable. This documentation, though,
is for that version.
