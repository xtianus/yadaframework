Complex tables made easy

== Introduction

https://datatables.net/[DataTables,window=_blank] is a very powerful javascript
library for creating tables with complex user interactions. It has dozens of
configuration options and can be quite complicated to set up correctly.
The Yada Framework implements a Java Fluent API that produces the required
javascript configuration and provides the needed backend functionality for
server-side data loading.

The current implementation covers all the core DataTables options and the 
https://datatables.net/extensions/responsive/[Responsive,window=_blank] extension.

TIP: A full example is implemented in the YadaExamples project.

== Prerequisites
The DataTables library can either be downloaded locally or from a CDN.
In both cases the official download page offers different options to package
the required elements into a downloadable zip or a specific CDN url for
javascript and CSS.
The Yada Framework implementation has been tested with:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Styling framework
|Bootstrap 5

h|Packages
|DataTables

h|Extensions
|Responsive 
|===

This example is for a downloaded version:

[source,html]
----
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" th:href="@{/static/datatables-2.1.8/datatables.min.css}"/>
</head>
...
<script th:src="@{/static/datatables-2.1.8/datatables.min.js}"></script>
----

The `yada.datatables.js` file also needs to be loaded. This is by default automatically
packaged in the war distribution for production but should be added in development:

[source,html]
----
<script th:if="${@config.developmentEnvironment}" th:src="@{/yadares/js/yada.datatables.js}"></script>
----

== HTML Code
The basic DataTable functionality is implemented just by adding the `yada:datatable` tag:

[source,html]
----
<yada:datatable # <1>
	yada:configuration="${userTableAttribute}"> # <2>
</yada:datatable>
----
<1> The tag inserts the table at the specified position in the HTML
<2> The configuration must have been set in the @Controller as a Model attribute, called "userTableAttribute" in this example

For advanced scenarios where you need to alter the configuration before
creating the table or work with the created table in javascript, two handlers
can be provided via `yada:preprocessor` and `yada:postprocessor`:

[source,html]
----
<yada:datatable 
	yada:configuration="${userTableAttribute}" 
	yada:preprocessor="userTablePreprocessor" # <1>
	yada:postprocessor="userTablePostprocessor"> # <2>
</yada:datatable>
----
<1> The preprocessor can alter the configuration before the table is created
<2> The postprocessor can operate on the table once it has been created

More details below.

== Java Fluent Interface
The configuration for a DataTable is implemented in a `YadaDataTable` instance.
This instance can be added to the Model with an attribute that has the same name
used in `yada:configuration`, e.g. `userTableAttribute` in the example above.

[source,java]
----
YadaDataTable myDataTable = ...
model.addAttribute("userTableAttribute", myDataTable);
----

The instance is a singleton identified by a unique id and is produced by `yadaDataTableFactory`.
This ensures that the table configuration code is run only once for all HTTP requests
and that the same configuration can be used in the ajax handler that loads the table data.

To create or get an instance the syntax is as follows:

[source,java]
----
YadaDataTable myDataTable = yadaDataTableFactory.getSingleton("myTableId", locale, ...);
----

The locale is needed to load the i18n file and can be omitted or set to null to use the default locale
that is either set in the application XML configuration or taken from the platform.
In a multilanguage application it should be taken from a parameter in the @Controller @RequestMapping.

The table configuration is added as a lambda after the locale parameter and uses the fluent iterface:

[source,java]
----
YadaDataTable yadaDataTable = yadaDataTableFactory.getSingleton("userTable", locale, table -> {
	table
		.dtAjaxUrl("someUrl")
		.dt ...
});
----

NOTE: Using the lambda ensures that the configuration code is run just once.

All methods of the fluent interface have the "dt" prefix. This makes IDE suggestions
more focused on the useful methods during autocompletion:

.Method Autocompletion
image::datatables.completion.jpg[Method Autocompletion]

When a configuration option has many parameters, the corresponding
method name has the "Obj" suffix because a new object is returned to provide the new
configuration methods. 
To "exit" from the current object, the `back()` method must be called.

=== Basic Configuration
The most basic table configuration, that can be used to show data taken from an @Entity,
only requires the entity class and fields:
 
[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping("/user")
public String users(Model model) {
	YadaDataTable basicTable = yadaDataTableFactory.getSingleton("basicTable", table -> {
		table
			.dtEntityClass(UserProfile.class) # <1>
			.dtStructureObj()
				.dtColumnObj("Email", "userCredentials.username").back() # <2>
				.dtColumnObj("Last Login", "userCredentials.lastSuccessfulLogin").back() # <2>
			.back();
	});
	model.addAttribute("basicTable", basicTable);
	return "/dashboard/users";
}
----
<1> Provide the class of the entity that holds data
<2> Provide the column names and the path of the properties that hold the value to show

.Basic Usage
image::datatables.basicuser.jpg[Basic Usage]

TIP: the endpoint is implemented in `YadaController.yadaDataTableData()` 

Data retrieval will be automatic and will have the same security restrictions of the page where
the table is shown, which is "/dashboard/user" in the example.

TIP: security is implemented in SecurityConfig if the application is secured 

=== Advanced Configuration
In more advanced scenarios the ajax endpoint returning data can be customized with `dtAjaxUrl()`.
This is an alternative approach to `dtEntityClass()` and using both will result in error. 
The argument of `dtAjaxUrl()` is the url for the ajax call that retrieves data
from the backend. It can contain any Thymeleaf expression and will be included
in a standard URL expression like `@{/myUrl}` when not already provided.

The dtStructureObj() top method starts configuration of the "structure" of the
table using a custom API that can be explored with autocompletion. This API
allows the definition of columns and buttons.

The other top method is `.dtOptionsObj()` that allows access to the official
DataTables https://datatables.net/reference/option/[options,window=_blank]. For example, the https://datatables.net/reference/option/pageLength[PageLength,window=_blank]  
option can be set with `.dtOptionsObj().dtPageLength(25)`.
All the DataTables core options and the Responsive extension options are available
unless they are deprecated or not applicable in the context of the Yada Framework, 
like https://datatables.net/reference/option/retrieve[retrieve,window=_blank].

TIP: anything that can't be done in Java can be done in javascript using pre- and post- processors.

== Java Ajax Endpoint
The Yada Framework implementation of DataTables assumes that data is fetched via ajax from the server,
therefore the https://datatables.net/reference/option/ajax[ajax option,window=_blank] is forced to be active.

The ajax endpoint is set via `.dtAjaxUrl()` on the YadaDataTable object as explained before. The
@Controller should query the database, performing searching and sorting, and return a JSON
file with the resulting data for the current page.

When the table shows data from @Entity objects, most of that code is already provided.

[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping(value ="/user/userProfileTablePage", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
@ResponseBody public Map<String, Object> userProfileTablePage(YadaDatatablesRequest yadaDatatablesRequest, Locale locale) { # <1>
	Map<String, Object> result = yadaDataTableDao.getConvertedJsonPage(yadaDatatablesRequest, UserProfile.class, locale);	# <2>
	return result;	# <3>
}
----
<1> YadaDatatablesRequest is initialized with the metadata sent by DataTables, like the current page number, the value paths and the search/sort options
<2> yadaDataTableDao.getConvertedJsonPage() receives the request data and the @Entity class to perform all needed operations
<3> The result is a "map tree" (i.e. nested maps) that is automatically converted to json

Using a custom endpoint for table data allows to manipulate both the query and the result, for example
by adding conditions or creating values not directly found on the entity:

toolbar, command bar, select column 

row class from the backend
