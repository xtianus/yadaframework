== Copy to clipboard
[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Scope
|HTML page
h|Language
|Javascript
|===

The `yada.copyToClipboard(extendedSelector, event, showFeedback)` method copies the content of some page element to the clipboard.

extendedSelector:: 
the CSS selector eventually with a yada prefix
event::
the event that triggered the copy (usually a click event). Propagation of this event will be stopped.
The event is also used to properly convert any yada prefix on the CSS selector
showFeedback::
whether to show a <<ajax.adoc#_ajax_feedback,feedback message>>

The following example is a "clone" icon that copies the content of an element with a specific id:

[source,HTML]
----
<a href="javascript:void(0);"
	th:onclick="|yada.copyToClipboard('#pub-${publication.id}', event, true)|"
	title="Copy to clipboard">
	<i class="fa fa-clone" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

== Lazy Initialization of class attributes
[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Scope
|Backend
h|Language
|Java
|===

A common pattern in methods is to check for some attribute to be null and make an 
instance otherwise, before using it.
Example:

[source,Java]
----
public void addToMyList(String data) {
	if (this.myList == null) {
		this.myList = new ArrayList();
	}
	this.myList.add(data);
}

public MyThing getMyThing(String somethingToSet) {
	if (this.myThing == null) {
		this.myThing = new MyThing();
	}
	this.myThing.setSomething(somethingToSet);
	return this.myThing;
}
----

This can be made more compact by using `YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit()`:

[source,Java]
----
public void addToMyList(String data) {
	this.myList = YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit(this.myList); # <1>
	this.myList.add(data);
}

public MyThing getMyThing(String somethingToSet) {
	this.myThing = YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit(this.myThing, MyThing::new); # <2>
	this.myThing.setSomething(somethingToSet);
	return this.myThing;
}

public MyThing getMyThing(String somethingToSet) {
	this.myThing = YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit(this.myThing, () -> new MyThing(this)); # <3>
	this.myThing.setSomething(somethingToSet);
	return this.myThing;
}

public void addToMyList(String data) {
	this.myList = YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit(this.myList, ArrayList::new); # <4>
	this.myList.add(data);
}
----

<3> Initializing an object with a constructor with arguments

CAUTION: In a multithreaded scenario there may be race conditions with unpredictable results. This is why the method is called "lazyUnsafeInit".

There are of course no race conditions if the attribute owner instance is itself guaranteed to ever be 
used by one thread only, for example when the owner instance is created
inside some method (i.e. is not a singleton), 
because each thread will have its own stack and its own instance of local variables.

Example:

[source,Java]
----
public class MyOwner {
	public SomeAttribute someAttribute;
}

public class MyProcessor {
	MyOwner mySingletonOwner = new MyOwner();
		
	public SomeAttribute process() {
		// THREAD SAFE
		MyOwner myOwner = new MyOwner();
		myOwner.someAttribute = YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit(myOwner.someAttribute, SomeAttribute::new); # <1>
		// NOT THREAD SAFE
		mySingletonOwner.someAttribute = YadaUtil.lazyUnsafeInit(myOwner.someAttribute, SomeAttribute::new); # <2>
		return mySingletonOwner.someAttribute; # <3>
	}
}
----
<1> This is always going to work properly because each thread entering the process() method has its own instance of MyOwner
<2> This is prone to race conditions if two threads enter the process() method because they would
	operate on the same instance of MyOwner but probably with their own copy of mySingletonOwner.someAttribute
<3> This is	going to be a problem later in the execution if each thread has its own copy of mySingletonOwner.someAttribute

In a multithreaded scenario, lazy initialization involves the use of volatile attributes and synchronization, so better
avoid it when possible.


== Lookup Tables
[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Scope
|Backend
h|Language
|Java
|===

A lookup table holds a value indexed by some other values. It is a generalisation
of a Map where a single key indexes a value: in a lookup table the key can be a collection of many values.
A simple implementation would be to concatenate the many keys into a single string to be
used as a key in a Map, or to use some key object that holds many values. 

A much better solution is to use the YadaLookupTable class:

[source,Java]
----
YadaLookupTable<Integer, String> lookupTable = new YadaLookupTable<>();
lookupTable.put("value1", 1, 2, 3);
lookupTable.put("value2", 1, 2, 4);
...
lookupTable.get(1, 2, 3); // "value1"
----

The keys must all be of the same type, that can be different from the type of the value.
In order to overcome this limitation, just use "Object" so that keys can be of mixed types.

For a better control on the key types, four other classes are provided:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|YadaLookupTableThree
|Lookup table with 3 columns: two keys as index for one value
h|YadaLookupTableFour
|Lookup table with 4 columns: three keys as index for one value
h|YadaLookupTableFive
|Lookup table with 5 columns: four keys as index for one value
h|YadaLookupTableSix
|Lookup table with 6 columns: five keys as index for one value
|===

[source,Java]
----
YadaLookupTableThree<Locale, Integer, String> lookupTable = new YadaLookupTableThree<>();
lookupTable.put(Locale.EN, 1, "Hello");
lookupTable.put(Locale.IT, 1, "Ciao");
...
lookupTable.get(Locale.EN, 1); // "Hello"
----

All implementations are efficient and thread safe.

== Error Handling
[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Scope
|Configuration, HTML page
h|Language
|XML, HTML
|===

An error can be generated either outside the application (e.g. an endpoint doesn't exist,
a thymeleaf template is not found) or
inside the application via an Exception. 
The first kind of error is handled by providing an error page in the `web.xml` file. The default
target is `/yadaError`. 

[source,XML]
----
<error-page>
	<location>/yadaError</location>
</error-page>
----

The second kind of error is handled by `YadaGlobalExceptionHandler`.

These are two very distinct types or errors but the user
doesn't need to be aware of the difference.
For both kinds of errors, an ajax request results in the contents of `ajaxError.html`;
for normal requests, the error details are set in some model attributes,
then execution is forwarded to the `@RequestMapping` configured with `<errorPageForward>`.
By default the target is the home page, where an error modal is shown.
To show a dedicated error page, a skeleton of which can be found in `errorPage.html`,
configure it as shown here: 

[source,XML]
----
<paths>
	<errorPageForward>/errorPage</errorPageForward>
</paths>
----

TIP: A dedicated error page is generally more robust because it better handles errors generated in
the home page itself

NOTE: The global exception handler does not process exceptions annotated with `@ResponseStatus` so
that Spring can handle them as expected

A very quick way to respond to a request with some HTTP error code (e.g. 404 "NOT FOUND") is to
throw a `RuntimeException` annotated with `@ResponseStatus`. For example `YadaHttpNotFoundException`:

[source,Java]
----
@ResponseStatus(value=HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)  // 404
public class YadaHttpNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
}
----

TODO: implement other HTTP error exceptions

== Favicon
[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Scope
|HTML page
h|Language
|HTML
|===
Browsers load the "/favicon.ico" url by default when nothing else has been 
specified in the HTML page or even when loading non-HTML pages, where the favicon location can't be
specified. It is therefore important to provide a valid response when this happens.
The "/favicon.ico" URL is handled by Yada Framework as long as a `favicon.ico` file is provided
in the `webapp` folder.

Other versions of the favicon can be specified in the header. It is good practice to put them in
a versioned folder so that it will be easier to bypass the browser cache in case the icons will be 
changed at a later date. The skeleton application has the following line in the header:

[source,HTML]
----
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" th:href="@{/static/favicons-1.0/favicon.ico}">
----

== document ready
[cols="1,1"]
|===
h|Scope
|HTML page
h|Language
|javascript
|===

Executing some javascript after the document has been fully loaded requires some lines of code that
check the state of the document and register an event handler. This has already been implemented
and inserted in the `header.html` file by the <<newEclipseProject#_code_generation_just_a_bit,yadaInit>> task 
used to create the initial project skeleton.
Example:

[source,javascript]
----
<script th:fragment="yexready">
	window.yex = window.yex || {};
	yex.ready = yex.ready || function (fn) {
		if (document.readyState != 'loading'){
			fn();
		} else {
			document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);
		}
	}
</script>
----

This can be used anywhere in all site pages that include it:

[source,javascript]
----
<script>
	yex.ready(function(){
		// do something on the fully loaded page
	});
</script>
----
