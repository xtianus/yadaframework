initialSize: The initial number of connections that are created when the pool is started.
maxTotal: The maximum number of active connections that can be allocated from this pool at the same time, or negative for no limit.
maxIdle: The maximum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra ones being released, or negative for no limit.
minIdle: The minimum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra ones being created, or zero to create none.
maxWaitMillis: The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no available connections) for a connection to be returned before throwing an exception, or -1 to wait indefinitely.
validationQuery: The SQL query that will be used to validate connections from this pool before returning them to the caller.
validationQueryTimeout: The timeout in seconds before connection validation queries fail.
testOnBorrow: The indication of whether objects will be validated before being borrowed from the pool.
maxConnLifetimeMillis: The maximum lifetime in milliseconds of a connection. After this time is exceeded the connection will fail the next activation, passivation or validation test. A value of zero or less means the connection has an infinite lifetime.
